### üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY: Prompt 11 ‚Äî Backend Foundation + Visual Design System

```text
Implement extensible backend foundation and visual-driven UI development:

**PHASE A: Backend Extensible Foundation (Priority 1)**

1. **Create FileProcessor interface** in `backend/app/services/file_processor.py`:
   - Abstract base class for all file type processors
   - Methods: validate_file(), detect_schema(), convert_to_database()
   - File type registry system for routing uploads to appropriate processors
   - Extensible foundation for CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet support

2. **Implement CSVProcessor** in `backend/app/services/csv_processor.py`:
   - First concrete FileProcessor implementation
   - pandas integration with automatic delimiter detection
   - Handle encoding issues (UTF-8, latin1, etc.) and schema inference
   - Convert CSV data to SQLite in-memory database for querying
   - Error handling for malformed files with user-friendly messages

3. **Create POST /data/upload endpoint** in `backend/app/api/data.py`:
   - Multi-format file upload with type detection and routing
   - Route to appropriate processor based on file extension
   - File validation and security checks (size limits, type validation)
   - Basic HTML response templates for testing backend functionality

4. **SQLite adapter integration**:
   - Compatible with existing LLM pipeline and query engine
   - Schema introspection for uploaded data sources
   - Query execution with same safety validations as existing code
   - Integrate with existing result formatting and pagination

5. **File management utilities**:
   - Session-based temporary file storage with automatic cleanup
   - File metadata tracking and retrieval system
   - Cleanup expired uploads and session data management

**PHASE B: Visual Design Implementation (Priority 2)**

6. **Design Reference Collection**:
   - SAMAR DON provides design screenshots and visual mockups
   - Reference existing UIs (ChatGPT, Linear, etc.) for inspiration
   - Define visual requirements and specifications for each screen
   - Establish design system and component patterns

7. **Puppeteer-Driven HTML Development**:
   - Take baseline screenshots of current implementation state
   - Create HTML templates matching design specifications exactly
   - Visual iteration loop: Screenshot ‚Üí Compare ‚Üí Adjust ‚Üí Repeat
   - Automated visual regression testing with screenshot comparison

8. **Core UI Templates Creation**:
   - File upload interface with drag-and-drop styling and visual feedback
   - Schema preview layout with data table and column information
   - Chat interface mockup with message bubbles and input areas
   - Results display with pagination controls and export options
   - Responsive design testing across multiple viewport sizes

**PHASE C: React Integration (Priority 3)**

9. **Template to Component Conversion**:
   - Convert proven HTML templates to React components systematically
   - Maintain exact visual fidelity using screenshot validation
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces and component structure
   - Integrate with existing authentication and API client infrastructure

10. **State Management and API Integration**:
    - Connect React components to backend APIs (upload, chat, results)
    - Implement proper error handling and loading states
    - Add file upload progress tracking and user feedback
    - Maintain existing LLM pipeline integration with chat interface

**TESTING & VALIDATION:**

11. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:
    - Backend: Unit tests for FileProcessor, CSV processing, SQLite conversion
    - Visual: Screenshot comparison tests for UI regression prevention
    - Frontend: Component tests for React integration and state management
    - E2E: Complete flow from file upload to query results

12. **Dependencies and Setup**:
    - Add pandas, openpyxl to backend dependencies for file processing
    - Configure Puppeteer for screenshot automation and visual testing
    - Create sample CSV files for testing various formats and edge cases

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
- Backend processes CSV files through extensible FileProcessor interface
- HTML templates match provided design specifications pixel-perfect
- Visual regression testing prevents UI degradation during development
- React components maintain template visual fidelity exactly
- Complete user flow: upload ‚Üí preview ‚Üí chat ‚Üí results works end-to-end
- Existing authentication and backend functionality remains unchanged
- Test coverage maintained at 85%+ across all components

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Extensible FileProcessor architecture for future file type support
- Visual-driven development using Puppeteer for design fidelity
- Session-based storage with automatic cleanup and file management
- Maintain existing LLM pipeline, SQL validation, result formatting
- Responsive design working across desktop, tablet, mobile viewports
- Support files up to 100MB with proper progress indication

**METHODOLOGY INNOVATION:**
- Backend-first approach ensures solid foundation before UI complexity
- Visual-driven development with Puppeteer prevents design drift
- HTML template foundation proven before React conversion
- Screenshot validation maintains pixel-perfect design implementation

This creates an extensible, visually-polished MVP with proper architectural foundation for future expansion.
