## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker (RECOMMENDED)

**For the fastest development experience:**

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup environment
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd snowflake-mcp-lambda
make setup  # Copies .env.example to .env

# 2. IMPORTANT: Edit .env with required values
# Required: GEMINI_API_KEY (for LLM functionality)
# Optional: GOOGLE_CLIENT_* (for auth), database passwords

# 3. Start everything with one command
make dev-setup
# This builds containers, starts services, and runs migrations

# 4. Access the application
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (React app)
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI)
# - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs (Interactive API docs)
```

**Common development commands:**
```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make up             # Start services
make down           # Stop services
make logs           # View all logs
make test           # Run backend tests
make health         # Check service health
make wait-healthy   # Wait for all services to be ready
make clean          # Clean up containers/volumes
```

## üí° Key Features

### üéØ MVP User Experience
1. **Upload CSV File** - Drag-and-drop interface with progress indication
2. **Schema Preview** - Auto-detected columns and data types with confirmation
3. **Chat Interface** - Ask questions about your data in natural language
4. **SQL Generation** - Gemini LLM converts questions to SQLite queries
5. **Results Display** - Interactive table with sorting, filtering, export options

### üîí Security & Privacy
- **No data persistence** - Files deleted after session ends
- **Read-only queries** - Only SELECT statements allowed
- **User-provided API keys** - Gemini API key never stored server-side
- **File validation** - Size limits, format validation, secure processing

### ‚ö° Performance
- **Fast uploads** - Supports files up to 100MB
- **Efficient processing** - CSV ‚Üí SQLite conversion with schema inference
- **Quick queries** - In-memory SQLite for fast query execution
- **Session-based** - No database dependencies for core functionality

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required API Keys

#### Gemini API (Required for LLM functionality)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add to your `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key`

#### Google OAuth (Optional for MVP)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
3. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/callback`
4. Add to `.env`: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Required for core functionality
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# Optional for authentication (can use without login)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Auto-generated secure secrets
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-db-password
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) + Poetry for dependency management
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Data Processing**: pandas + SQLite for CSV file handling
- **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini API for natural language queries
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with JWT cookies (optional)
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development

## üß™ Testing & Development

### Pre-commit Quality Checks
Our pre-commit hooks run the same checks as CI for immediate feedback:
- **Ruff** - Fast Python linting and formatting
- **MyPy** - Type checking with strict mode
- **Pytest** - Full test suite with 85%+ coverage requirement
- **Security** - Basic vulnerability scanning

```bash
# Setup development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# All commits now run full CI checks locally
# (30-60 seconds per commit, but zero CI failures)
```

### Test Coverage
- **Backend**: 91%+ coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Frontend**: Component tests with vitest + E2E tests with cypress
- **File Processing**: Edge cases for various CSV formats and encodings
- **LLM Integration**: Mocked Gemini responses for reliable testing

## üìã Development Status

### Implementation Progress
**See `docs/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for detailed status and next steps**

Key files for developers and AI assistants:
- `docs/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current status and ready-to-execute prompts
- `docs/planning/spec_v2.md` - Complete feature requirements and architecture
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer setup and troubleshooting guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context for AI code assistants

### Current Priority: CSV Upload MVP
The next major milestone is implementing CSV file upload capability that allows users to:
1. Upload CSV files without requiring database credentials
2. Preview and validate detected schema
3. Query uploaded data using natural language via chat
4. Export results and manage session data

This creates a complete, demo-ready application that works entirely with user-provided files.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Notes

This project is designed for seamless AI-assisted development:

### Why Comprehensive Pre-commit Hooks?
AI assistants can't directly access CI logs. When CI fails, humans must manually copy error messages back to the AI, creating a frustrating debugging loop. Our solution:

- **Immediate feedback** - AI gets errors instantly, not after CI failure
- **Same environment** - What passes locally passes in CI
- **Faster iteration** - Fix issues in the same conversation
- **No context switching** - AI can resolve issues without human intervention

### AI Assistant Friendly Features
- **Clear documentation** - Comprehensive planning docs in `docs/planning/`
- **Ready-to-execute prompts** - Specific implementation tasks in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- **Modular architecture** - Clean separation of concerns for focused changes
- **Comprehensive tests** - Confidence that changes don't break existing functionality

This approach transforms AI assistants from helpful but sometimes frustrating to genuinely reliable development partners.
