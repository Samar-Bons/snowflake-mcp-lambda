# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Data Chat MVP** - A full-stack web application enabling non-technical users to upload CSV files and query them using natural language via an AI-powered chat interface. The project is essentially complete at ~95% implementation status.

## Architecture

**Core Stack:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with Poetry dependency management
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (dark mode)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth with JWT cookies and Redis session management
- **Data**: PostgreSQL (users), Redis (sessions), SQLite (uploaded CSV data)  
- **LLM**: Google Gemini API (BYOK - user provides API key)
- **Deploy**: Docker Compose for development environment

**Key Flow:**
1. User uploads CSV file â†’ auto-conversion to SQLite with schema detection
2. Natural language input â†’ Gemini LLM â†’ SQL generation with confirmation modal
3. SQL execution â†’ paginated results display with export capabilities
4. Session-based temporary data storage (cleanup after session expires)

## Development Commands

**Python Package Management:**
- **Poetry** - Dependency management (backend/pyproject.toml)
- Install deps: `docker compose exec backend poetry install`
- Add packages: `docker compose exec backend poetry add <package>`
- Run scripts: `docker compose exec backend poetry run <script>`
- No requirements.txt needed - packages stored in pyproject.toml

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Complete Setup
make dev-setup                  # Full environment setup with health checks
make setup                      # Copy .env.example to .env (edit required)

# Daily Development  
make up                         # Start all services
make down                       # Stop all services
make logs                       # View all logs
make wait-healthy               # Wait for all services ready

# Backend Development
make shell-backend              # Open backend container shell
make logs-backend               # Backend logs only
docker compose exec backend poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend Development
make shell-frontend             # Open frontend container shell  
make logs-frontend              # Frontend logs only

# Testing (MUST pass before task completion)
make test                       # Backend tests with 85%+ coverage requirement
make test-frontend              # Frontend tests with Vitest
make test-all                   # All tests (backend + frontend)

# Inside backend container for specific tests:
poetry run pytest -k test_name              # Run specific test
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html  # Coverage report

# Quality Checks (MUST pass before task completion)
make lint-frontend              # Frontend ESLint/Prettier
make type-check-frontend        # TypeScript type checking  
pre-commit run --all-files      # All quality checks (Ruff, MyPy, tests)

# Database Operations
make db-migrate                 # Run Alembic migrations
make db-reset                   # Reset database (destroys data)

# Health & Validation
make health                     # Check all service health
make validate-config            # Validate project configuration
make deep-health-check          # Comprehensive health validation
```

## Architecture Details

**Backend Structure (`backend/app/`):**
- `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point with middleware and routing
- `auth/` - Google OAuth, JWT utilities, user management
- `llm/` - Gemini API integration for natural language to SQL conversion
- `data/` - CSV upload, SQLite adapter, file processing pipeline
- `snowflake/` - Snowflake connection management (future expansion)
- `models/` - SQLAlchemy models (User, Connection)
- `core/` - Database configuration and shared utilities

**Frontend Structure (`frontend/src/`):**  
- `main.tsx` - React application entry point
- `pages/` - Main application pages (Landing, Chat)
- `components/` - Reusable UI components organized by feature
- `services/` - API client, authentication, file upload, chat logic
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useAuth)
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

**Key Configuration Files:**
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Poetry dependencies, pytest config, Ruff/MyPy settings
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service development environment
- `Makefile` - Development commands and Docker operations
- `.env` - Environment variables (copy from .env.example)

## Testing Philosophy

**TDD Required:** Write failing test â†’ minimal implementation â†’ refactor
**All test types mandatory:** unit, integration, end-to-end  
**85%+ coverage requirement** enforced by pytest configuration
**Real data/APIs only** - no mocking implementations
**Pristine test output required** - must pass completely before task completion

**Backend Testing (`backend/tests/`):**
- 165+ passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- Test markers: `slow`, `integration`, `e2e`
- Key test files: `test_chat_endpoints.py`, `test_csv_processor.py`, `test_gemini_service.py`

**Frontend Testing (`frontend/src/`):**
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Service layer tests for API integration  
- Vitest + jsdom testing environment

## Security Constraints

- **Read-only SQL queries** only (SELECT statements enforced)
- **Intent classification** to detect unsafe prompts
- **Secure file upload** validation (size limits, type checking)
- **Session-based temporary data** storage with cleanup
- **User-provided API keys** (BYOK model) - never stored server-side
- **No sensitive data** in logs or commits

## Current Implementation Status

**âœ… Completed (95%):**
- Complete backend API with all endpoints functional
- Google OAuth authentication with JWT and Redis sessions
- CSV file upload and processing pipeline with SQLite conversion
- Gemini LLM integration for natural language to SQL conversion  
- React frontend with authentication flow and responsive design
- Docker development environment with health checks
- Comprehensive testing suite with 85%+ coverage

**ðŸ”„ Minor Remaining:**
- ~60 TypeScript errors to resolve
- Mobile responsiveness validation  
- Production deployment configuration

## File Headers Standard

All code files must start with:
```python
# ABOUTME: [Brief description of file purpose]
# ABOUTME: [Second line of description]
```

- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer setup and troubleshooting
- `API_CONTRACT.md` - API endpoint specifications
- `MVP_UI_UX_DESIGN_SPEC.md` - UI/UX design requirements

## Next Implementation Priority

**TypeScript Error Resolution** - The primary remaining task is resolving ~60 TypeScript compilation errors to achieve a fully production-ready state. Most errors are type annotation issues that don't affect runtime functionality.
