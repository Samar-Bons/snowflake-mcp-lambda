# Test Coverage Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-07-24
**Current Coverage**: 61% (Required: 85%)
**Gap**: 24 percentage points

## Executive Summary

The backend test coverage is at 61% instead of the required 85% primarily due to missing tests for the CSV upload MVP implementation. The project underwent a pivot from Snowflake-only to CSV file upload support, and the new modules lack test coverage.

   - **Status**: NO TESTS EXIST

2. **app/services/csv_processor.py** - 16% coverage (144/171 lines missing)
   - CSV file processing with pandas
   - Encoding detection
   - SQLite conversion
   - **Status**: NO TESTS EXIST

3. **app/data/sqlite_adapter.py** - 16% coverage (112/133 lines missing)
   - SQLite schema service
   - Integration with LLM pipeline
   - Query execution adapter
   - **Status**: NO TESTS EXIST

4. **app/data/endpoints.py** - 30% coverage (68/97 lines missing)
   - File upload endpoint
   - Multi-format routing
   - Validation logic
   - **Status**: NO TESTS EXIST

### Well-Tested Modules (for comparison)

- **app/snowflake/schema_service.py** - 98% coverage
- **app/llm/gemini_service.py** - 98% coverage
- **app/auth/user_service.py** - 100% coverage
- **app/health.py** - 100% coverage

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. MVP Pivot Impact
The project pivoted from Snowflake-exclusive to CSV file upload support. This introduced four new modules that were implemented without corresponding tests:
- File management system
- CSV processor
- SQLite adapter
- Data upload endpoints

### 2. Test Files Missing
No test files exist for:
- `test_csv_processor.py`
- `test_file_management.py`
- `test_sqlite_adapter.py`
- `test_data_endpoints.py`

### 3. Implementation Timeline
Based on the git history and project status documents:
- Backend foundation (Phases 0-4) achieved 91%+ coverage
- CSV upload MVP (Phase 5) was implemented without tests
- The coverage dropped from ~91% to 61% due to untested new code

## Detailed Missing Coverage

### app/services/file_management.py (14% coverage)
Missing tests for:
- `FileManager.__init__` - Redis client initialization
- `get_user_dir` - User directory creation
- `save_file` - File storage with metadata
- `get_file_path` - File retrieval
- `delete_file` - File deletion
- `cleanup_expired_files` - Automatic cleanup
- `list_user_files` - File listing
- `get_file_metadata` - Metadata retrieval

### app/services/csv_processor.py (16% coverage)
Missing tests for:
- `CSVProcessor.validate_file` - File validation
- `detect_encoding` - Encoding detection logic
- `detect_delimiter` - CSV delimiter detection
- `process_file` - Main processing pipeline
- `_convert_to_sqlite` - SQLite conversion
- `_get_pandas_dtype` - Type mapping
- `_sanitize_column_name` - Column name sanitization

### app/data/sqlite_adapter.py (16% coverage)
Missing tests for:
- `SQLiteSchemaService.set_active_file` - File activation
- `discover_schema` - Schema discovery
- `get_column_info` - Column metadata
- `validate_query` - Query validation
- `execute_query` - Query execution
- `format_schema_context` - LLM context formatting

### app/data/endpoints.py (30% coverage)
Missing tests for:
- `upload_file` - Main upload endpoint
- `get_file_schema` - Schema retrieval endpoint
- `query_file` - File query endpoint
- `cleanup_files` - Cleanup endpoint
- Validation utilities

## Impact Assessment

### Risks of Low Coverage
1. **Untested file upload** - Core MVP functionality lacks validation
2. **No SQLite integration tests** - Query pipeline not verified
3. **Missing edge cases** - Encoding issues, malformed CSVs, large files
4. **Security gaps** - File validation and sanitization untested

### Technical Debt
- 567 lines of untested code across 4 critical modules
- No integration tests for CSV→SQLite→Query flow
- No error handling validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Create test files for all missing modules**
   - `test_csv_processor.py` - Unit tests for CSV processing
   - `test_file_management.py` - File operations and Redis integration
   - `test_sqlite_adapter.py` - SQLite schema and query tests
   - `test_data_endpoints.py` - Endpoint integration tests

2. **Test critical paths first**
   - File upload validation
   - CSV to SQLite conversion
   - Schema discovery
   - Query execution

### Test Implementation Strategy
1. **Unit Tests** (increase coverage to ~70%)
   - Mock dependencies (Redis, filesystem)
   - Test individual methods
   - Cover error cases

2. **Integration Tests** (increase coverage to ~80%)
   - End-to-end file upload flow
   - CSV processing with real files
   - SQLite query execution

3. **Edge Case Tests** (achieve 85%+ coverage)
   - Large file handling
   - Encoding issues
   - Malformed CSV data
   - Concurrent access

## Conclusion

The 24% coverage gap is entirely due to the CSV upload MVP implementation lacking tests. This represents a significant risk as these untested modules are core to the MVP functionality. The project's TDD philosophy was not followed during this phase, resulting in technical debt that must be addressed before deployment.

**Estimated effort to reach 85% coverage**: 2-3 days of focused test writing
**Risk if deployed at current coverage**: HIGH - Core functionality untested
