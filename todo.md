## Key Implementation Decisions

✅ **TDD Approach**: All phases follow test-driven development
✅ **Incremental Build**: Each phase builds on previous without orphaned code
✅ **Security First**: Read-only queries, proper validation, secure storage
✅ **User Experience**: ChatGPT-like interface with dark mode only
✅ **BYOK Model**: Users provide their own Gemini API keys
✅ **Microservice Ready**: Clean separation of concerns for future scaling

---

## Quality Gates

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% required
- **Performance**: <2s query response time
- **Security**: OWASP top 10 compliance
- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks must pass
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and user guides

---

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Start Phase 0.1 - Repository Setup & Standards
2. **Reference**: Use detailed prompts in plan.md for each implementation step
3. **Tracking**: Create GitHub issues for project tracking
4. **Method**: Begin TDD implementation cycle

## Notes

- All prompts designed to build incrementally
- Each phase includes comprehensive testing requirements
- Security and performance considerations built into each step
- Documentation requirements included throughout
- Production deployment considerations from start
